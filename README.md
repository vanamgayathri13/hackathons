# Hackathon Projects

This repository contains my hackathon projects, presentations, and ideas.  
Each folder includes slides (PPT/PDF), related code (if any), and notes about the project.

## 📌 Purpose

I regularly participate in hackathons to practice problem-solving, teamwork, and rapid prototyping.  
This repo shows my approach, creative ideas, and learnings — even when not selected.

## 🏆 Why share this?

I believe in sharing my journey and progress.  
These projects show my commitment to building ideas and learning from every attempt.
